# DAKboard WiFi & Performance Optimization on the Raspberry Pi 4b Running DakboardOS

This project started when I had a recurring DakboardOS issue leaving my Raspberry Pi4b networking in a bad state with no way to correct it but unplugging the pi. I was unable to find an answer through the official support channels, not that they aren't competent, but going back and forth over e-mail is very hard for both sides to get much done in an efficient manner as anyone who has ever done tech support can tell you.  I explain what I discoverd my problem was in the docs, but in addressing the change for my original problem I identified a handful of areas of improvement and optomization specific to a Raspberry Pi 4b that significiantly improved the stability and performance of my system and I have not had an issue since -- so I tried to package it up into a semi-automated process to share. I hope it helps someone.

## What's Fixed/Optimized
- ✅ WiFi stability / Fixed Network Adapter Crash
- ✅ Browser performance and memory usage
- ✅ System performance and cooling
- ✅ Web server configuration
- ✅ Automatic monitoring and recovery

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anthony-maio/dakboard-optimization.git
cd dakboard-optimization

# Run the installation
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
sudo ./scripts/install.sh

# Verify the installation
sudo ./scripts/verify.sh
```

## System Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB+ RAM recommended)
- DAKboardOS with SSH enabled
- Active cooling recommended (but not required)

## What Changed?
1. **WiFi Stability**
   - Disabled power management
   - Optimized antenna configuration
   - Improved coexistence with Bluetooth

2. **Performance**
   - Optimized memory allocation
   - Improved browser settings
   - Enhanced system configuration

3. **Monitoring**
   - Added watchdog configuration
   - Implemented system monitoring
   - Automatic recovery procedures
