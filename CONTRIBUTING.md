# Contributing to DAKboard WiFi Fixes & Optimizations

## What's This All About?

This is basically a collection of fixes and optimizations that came from troubleshooting WiFi issues on a Raspberry Pi 4 running DAKboardOS. While fixing the WiFi, we discovered and optimized:
- Web server configuration
- Browser settings
- System performance
- Memory usage
- Network settings

## The Story Behind This

What started as a simple "let's fix this WiFi problem" turned into "oh, we should probably fix that too" and "wait, that's not set up right" and "while we're here..."

Each fix led to discovering something else that could be improved, and before I knew it, I had a whole collection of optimizations. Figured others might benefit from all this troubleshooting, so here we are!

Haven't experienced the original issue since, you can read the technical details of that if you are curious in the docs.

## License

This is all MIT licensed - use it however you want. Just remember that these fixes worked for my setup, so you might need to adjust things for yours.

No fancy processes, no rigid rules - just sharing what worked and helping others avoid the same headaches we ran into.

These fixes are provided as-is and unfortunately I am unlikely to have the time or knowledge to support Dakboard, but you should contact their support for help if you need it.
